# Creative Text Generation Using Hugging Face and Gradio

## Project Description
This project integrates Hugging Face's text-to-text pipeline with Gradio, providing an interactive application for text generation. Utilizing the GPT-Neo model from EleutherAI, it allows users to input prompts and generates creative text responses.

## Repository Contents
- `tuwaiq_assignment_FI_01.ipynb`: Full implementation notebook with Gradio interface.
- `tuwaiq_assignment_SP_01.ipynb`: Notebook showcasing the Hugging Face pipeline without the Gradio interface.
- `tuwaiq_assignmentGI_01.ipynb`: Notebook focused on the Gradio interface setup.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing all libraries needed to run the notebooks.

## How the Hugging Face Text-to-Text Pipeline Works
The project utilizes the `transformers` library from Hugging Face, which provides a simple API for natural language processing tasks. The text-to-text pipeline:
- Accepts a textual prompt.
- Processes the input using the GPT-Neo model.
- Outputs generated text that extends or responds to the input prompt.

## Running the Code
Open your preferred Jupyter environment and run the notebooks:
- `tuwaiq_assignment_FI_01.ipynb` for the full implementation with Gradio.
- `tuwaiq_assignment_SP_01.ipynb` to explore how the Hugging Face pipeline works without Gradio.
- `tuwaiq_assignmentGI_01.ipynb` for details on the Gradio interface setup.

## Expected Output
When interacting with the Gradio interface, you can expect:
- A textbox for entering prompts.
- A slider to adjust the temperature parameter, influencing the creativity of the generated text.
- An output box displaying the generated text.
